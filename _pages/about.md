Hi and welcome to my website! My name is Garrett Yagade from Phoenix, Arizona and I am new to the data science world. I created this website to show projects that I have completed while studying for my Masters Degree as well as projects I completed during my free time.

Currently I am a Chemist at Fujifilm Electronic Materials and have been in the chemicals industry for the past 7 years. During my time as a chemist, I have learned skills that I believe are transferrable into the data science space.

This past May, I graduated with a Masters Degree in Business Analytics from Syracuse University with Beta Gamma Sigma honors and enjoyed learning about data science while pursuing my degree.
